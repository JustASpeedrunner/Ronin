Ronin is a speedrun client for speedrunners to speedrun more speedily.

[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-49fcb4?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/TF2SR/Ronin/releases)

## Installation

Simply drag & drop all the files from the `Ronin.release.vX.X.X.zip` into your main Titanfall2 directory

You can add the Launcher to your Steam library by clicking the `[+] Add a Game` -> `Add a Non-Steam Game` and then add the executable. You can also give it extra launch options through Steam that way

## Development

Northstar's development is split into 2 repositories:

1. [RoninLauncher](https://github.com/TF2SR/RoninLauncher) (Code for the C++ hook DLL)
1. [RoninMods](https://github.com/TF2SR/RoninMods) (Code for the squirrel mods that add menus & other features)

## Special Thanks

Thanks to everyone in the NorthstarTF Discord that helped me out and answered all my silly questions about how to make things<br>
Thanks to Taskinoz for laying the groundwork that taught me how to do basic Squirrel mods<br>
Thanks to Fzzy for wedging through C++ hell for me
